notes - finalizing the home range analysis - aug 2016

volume intersection looks ok
area overlap (the manual one) looks fucked up for some of them
	which sucks, because it takes forfuckingever to run
  -issues: NAs in spr15ao that aren't NA in spr15vi
	-all indivs that stopped transmitting in fall 2015

narrowing down the issue
-the indivs are in the elklist for spr15
-Winter 2015 is correctly identified in MigHr of locs
